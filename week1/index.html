        <li>Activate Yeast: a large bowl, combine warm milk and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>Mix Dough: Add sugar, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, flour, and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead Dough: Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Shape Donuts: Roll out the dough to ½-inch thickness and cut out donuts using a donut cutter. Place them on a baking sheet, cover, and let rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fry Donuts: Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C). Fry the donuts in batches for 1-2 minutes per side until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Prepare Glaze: Mix powdered sugar and milk in a bowl. Add food coloring if desired. Dip the donuts in the glaze and add sprinkles.</li>
